        While looking for an adventure the four of us met at the foothills of
        the Himalayas. The night prior to our adventure we sat together breaking
        bread sharing a steaming pot of soup while a rumbling river filled the
        quiet air. While the temperature was anything but warm the conversation
        shared between us kept us plenty warm. We talked well into the night
        about Art, Music, Travel and our many adventures. This friendship was so
        special EVERYONE should have the opportunity to do the same. On one of
        our many adventures we shared we wanted to build something truly
        special. Something more than a business, a project where we are able to
        share Art, Music, and Adventure. Through this The Bohemian Boys was
        created. Welcome to the greatest adventure of your life. Who is ready to
        become a Bohemian Boy?!
