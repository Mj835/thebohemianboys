        The four of us met at the foothills of Himalayas, looking to add
        adventure to the mundane. The night before the trek, we sat to together
        with mugs of steaming soup, by the side of rumbling river. In the cold
        of the night, we shared the warmth of stories about Art, Travel, Music
        and Adventure. As the river rumbled in the deep silence of the
        Mountains, we got caught in the flow of ideas and a gusto for adventure.
        We shared ideas. We played music. We shared the excitement of the first
        moment of a great friendship. Even after the trip, we took time out of
        our busy lives to stay connected, the magic of that special night still
        burning strong. It was the advent of our friendship and much more. We
        got together time and again to continue our ramblings about Art and
        Adventure. One day over cups of hot lattes and Marlboro puffs we had the
        idea, an idea for a community which was more than business, we wanted to
        defy the formal way of corporate world. It’s called what it should be,
        The Bohemian Boys, a community for people who do not know how to feel
        sorry. Who want to live more, do more and be more. A special tribe to
        share Art, Music and Adventure. We hope that you’ll be a part of our
        journey. Always and forever, The Bohemian Boyss
